# 🐧 Penguin – Student-First Finance Companion  

## 📌 Overview  
Indian college students (18–24) face unique financial challenges such as peer pressure spending, irregular side gig income, and a lack of structured financial literacy. Existing apps help track expenses but fail to build **financial confidence** or address **student-specific needs** like rent-splitting, savings discipline, or UPI-driven transactions.  

**Penguin** is designed as a **student-first financial companion** that nurtures healthy financial habits through gamification, UPI-first payment infrastructure, and accessible saving/investing features.  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
- Students struggle with **budgeting**, **rent sharing**, and **overspending**.  
- Existing apps (Splitwise, Jupiter, Cred, etc.) solve for transactions but not for **confidence-building or habit formation**.  
- Financial literacy tools are either boring, too complex, or lack student relevance.  

---

## 🔑 Key Features (MVP)  
- **UPI-First Payment Infrastructure**: Scan & Pay, group settlements, shared expenses.  
- **Pocket Vault & Planned Goals**: Emergency savings + structured goal-based saving with rewards.  
- **Small-Scale Investing**: ₹30–₹50 entry-point investments to build confidence.  
- **Analytics & Tracking**: Visual dashboards + behavioral insights for awareness.  
- **Onboarding Quiz**: Fun mascot-driven personalization for contextual nudges.  
- **Gamification**: Financial scores, monthly “Penguin Report Card,” and habit rewards.

## 📊 Analytics & Dataset Insights  
We analyzed a **survey dataset of 1,000+ Indian college students** to understand financial challenges, spending patterns, and saving behaviors.  

Key insights uncovered:  
- **Allowance distribution**: Majority between ₹3k–₹5k; <₹3k group reported higher overspending.  
- **Spending categories**: Rent + outings took up over 60% of monthly allowance.  
- **Top challenges**: Overspending (52%), lack of emergency fund (34%), irregular income (28%).  
- **Financial confidence gap**: Students with side gigs showed higher confidence but lacked structured saving habits.  

These insights directly shaped **feature prioritization** (UPI-first infra, pocket vault, gamification) to ensure Penguin solved the most pressing pain points.
